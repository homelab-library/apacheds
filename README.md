## About Apache DS

[Apache DS](https://directory.apache.org/apacheds/)

ApacheDSâ„¢ is an extensible and embeddable directory server entirely written in Java,
which has been certified LDAPv3 compatible by the Open Group. Besides LDAP it supports
Kerberos 5 and the Change Password Protocol. It has been designed to introduce triggers,
stored procedures, queues and views to the world of LDAP which has lacked these rich constructs.
