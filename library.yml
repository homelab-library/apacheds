  ApacheDSâ„¢ is an extensible and embeddable directory server entirely written in Java,
  which has been certified LDAPv3 compatible by the Open Group. Besides LDAP it supports
  Kerberos 5 and the Change Password Protocol. It has been designed to introduce triggers,
  stored procedures, queues and views to the world of LDAP which has lacked these rich constructs.
